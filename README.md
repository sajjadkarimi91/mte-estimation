# Multivariate Transfer Entropy Estimation using Coupled Hidden Markov Models

This repository contains MATLAB codes for estimating Multivariate Transfer Entropy (MTE) using Coupled Hidden Markov Models (CHMMs), specifically Latent Structure Influence Models (LSIMs). The implementation is based on research published in the IEEE ICBME 2022 conference.

## üìã Abstract

Studying complex dynamical systems such as the brain requires identifying causal relationships from brain signals like EEG. In such systems, causal inference is challenging since datasets are often high-dimensional, nonlinear, noisy, and often with small sample sizes. Using multivariate transfer entropy (MTE), causal relationships can be inferred in linear and nonlinear ways.

In this study, latent structure influence models (LSIMs) are adapted to develop a novel MTE estimator that measures effective connectivity in multivariate time series. LSIMs are a specific type of coupled hidden Markov model (CHMM) in which hidden Markov chain interactions are expressed as influence models.

Simulated datasets from neural mass models (NMMs) are used to compare the proposed estimator with the existing k-nearest neighbors (kNN) method at different conditions, including data length, signal-to-noise ratio, and network size. Using ground-truth structure networks, we define a binary classification problem for recovering directed edges from NMM simulation datasets in each specific condition.

**Key Finding**: Based on the AUCPR criterion, the proposed MTE estimator for NMMs is more effective than the standard kNN method. The proposed LSIM-based method outperforms the existing kNN method by about 3.7% in AUCPR values for SNRs in the range of 0 dB to 5 dB.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **MATLAB** (R2018b or later recommended)
2. **Dependencies**:
   - [CHMM-LSIM MATLAB Toolbox](https://github.com/sajjadkarimi91/chmm-lsim-matlab-toolbox)
   - [HERMES Toolbox](https://github.com/guiomar/HERMES)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important System Compatibility Note

**HERMES Toolbox MEX File Dependency**: The HERMES toolbox requires compiled MEX files (`tim_matlab.mex*`) that are platform-specific. If you encounter the following error:

```
Unrecognized function or variable 'tim_matlab'.
Error in entropy_combination (line 95)
    I(i) = tim_matlab(...
```

**Solutions by Operating System:**

- **Windows**: MEX files are typically included and should work out-of-the-box
- **macOS/Linux**: You may need to compile the MEX files manually:
  1. Navigate to `HERMES Toolbox/lib/tim-matlab-1.2.0/`
  2. Run `mex tim_matlab.c` in MATLAB
  3. Ensure the compiled file is in your MATLAB path

**Alternative**: If MEX compilation fails, you can still run the LSIM-based comparisons by commenting out the HERMES-related code in `main_nms_connectivity.m` (lines 113-120).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mte-estimation.git
   cd mte-estimation
   ```

2. Add the required toolboxes to your MATLAB path:
   ```matlab
   addpath(genpath('chmm-lsim-matlab-toolbox-main'))
   addpath(genpath('HERMES Toolbox'))
   ```

### Running the Simulations

1. **Generate simulation data and results**:
   ```matlab
   main_nms_connectivity
   ```
   This script will:
   - Generate neural mass model simulations
   - Apply different noise levels (SNR: -10 to 20 dB)
   - Test various network sizes (3, 5, 10 channels)
   - Compare LSIM vs kNN methods
   - Save results to `nms_mte_results.mat`

2. **Generate paper figures**:
   ```matlab
   paper_plots
   ```
   This will create:
   - ROC curves
   - Precision-Recall curves
   - Performance comparison plots
   - All figures saved in `figs/` directory

## üìä Results

### Performance Comparison

The proposed LSIM-based MTE estimator shows superior performance compared to the standard kNN method across various conditions:
